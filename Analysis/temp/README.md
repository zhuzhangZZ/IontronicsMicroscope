## Note added by Sanli on 20-04-2019

The gitlab server has a very limited space for our projects. Do not put bulky data (>10 MB) on this repository.

Use dropbox, onedrive, or other cloud services to share such files and put a link here. 

If data is only for local use, make sure to add the folder/filename to gitignore
